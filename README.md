# React + TypeScript + Vite

As a best approach, I've decided to go with React + Typescript + Vite because CRA has been deprecated and vite is the best option to build fast.

Redux toolkit has been used in this project, which is most popular redux tool.

In order to keep clean code, eslint has been configured.

`Required node version` is `20`

## Steps to run application

or
